"""Regex retrieval stage.

For each dimension we compile one case-insensitive pattern per allowed *value*.
A value matches when it appears in the prompt as a whole word/phrase (word
boundaries, so ``"Man"`` does not fire inside ``"management"``). A dimension
whose value(s) match becomes a candidate, and each matched value is emitted as a
regex :class:`~persona.treiver.treiver.Attribute` with the matched span as
evidence.

This does double duty:

* **as the RAG retriever** — the set of matched dimension ids is exactly the
  candidate set handed to the LLM judge.
* **as a standalone algorithm** — its emitted attributes are usable on their
  own when you don't want to call an LLM (offline, deterministic, free).

The matching is intentionally literal: high precision, low recall. Paraphrases
("she") won't match the value ``"Woman"``; that recall gap is what the LLM
judge stage is for.
