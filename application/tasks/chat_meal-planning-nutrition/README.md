# Personalized Meal Planning & Nutrition Assistant

PersonaBench application task for an AI nutrition and meal-planning chatbot exposed through a REST chat API. The persona agent acts as a simulated user seeking personalized meal plans, has a multi-turn conversation with the sidecar, and saves the resulting transcript and feedback artifacts.

## Domain

Healthcare & Commerce & Retail — evaluates safety, personalization, dietary accuracy, and adherence support.

## Contract

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Sidecar health check |
| `POST` | `/v1/session` | Create a meal planning session |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Send one user message and receive one assistant reply |
| `GET` | `/v1/conversation?sessionId=...` | Fetch the full transcript |
| `GET` | `/v1/recommendations?sessionId=...` | Fetch meal plan recommendations accumulated across turns |

## Expected Artifacts

The persona agent writes:

- `/app/output/transcript.json`
- optionally `/app/output/user_feedback.json`

The verifier checks artifact shape, multi-turn coverage, session consistency, and nutrition-specific quality signals.
